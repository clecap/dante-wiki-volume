# DanteSnippets #

DanteSnippets is an extension producing author produced previews when hovering over links or other suitable
anchors in a MediWiki installation.


#### Why yet another extension? ####

Q: There are already similar extensions. Isn't https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Popups and https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TextExtracts 
just the same thing?

A: The mentioned extensions rely on a specific automated service for producing the previews. The author thus does not have sufficient control over the content of
the snippets. This extension allows the author a more precise control.
