When onParserFirstCallInit is called and usedHashs is still undefined, we load the page property ParsifalHashsUsed from the data base.
This property contains an array of all hashs which have been processed for this page.


Throughout the calling of the hook, we collect in the output object property in ParsifalHashsUsed the hashs we
meet while processing the hook.

In the end, every page has a property ParsifalHashsUsed containing a serialized PHP array value with all the hashs 
used on this page.

For deleting stale files we have to
1) collect an array of all hash values by traversing the file system
2) traversing the page_props table collecting all ParsifalHashsUsed arrays and removing them from this collection array
