* Smooth, double buffered previews of the page, particularly useful for Parsifal
* Allows a dynamic, persisted horizontal edit area resize
* Maximizes edit page space in the vertical direction
* Removes the annoying "Your edit was saved" confirmation (in dantePresentatsions.css)
* Optional use of Codemirror for editing, including line numbers and LaTeX support (if Parsifal is installed)
* Reveal.js formatted slide view
