# TreeAndMenu

This repository is a branch of the TreeAndMenu mediawiki extension originally at
* https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:TreeAndMenu
* https://gitlab.com/organicdesign/TreeAndMenu/

Years ago I started to hack the original extension a bit without properly documenting it.
Then somehow the original was updated and this branch made it difficult for me to keep up with it. This repository helps me keep my version somehow stable and available without having the need to completely reengineer it.


## Patches Made

* Category links in the category tree open in a seperate window on the left of the screen.



## Status 

Currently alpha and incomplete.
