# DanteBread #

DanteBread is a compact and ultra-fast breadcrumb extension without FOUC, delays and similar problems.

It fixes numerous problems of other breadcrumb extensions where 
* Style files load too late and produce flicker 
* Script files wait for page load and produce flicker 
* Unnecessary options make the configuration problematic 
* Double entries make the bread crumb crowded  
* and many more
